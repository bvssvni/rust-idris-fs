rust-idris-fs
=============

An attempt at writing C libraries in Rust that can be called from Idris  

Rust is a low level language but with a rapidly growing number of available libraries.  
Idris is a high level language with dependent types with a REPL environment.  

Both are languages focused on safety and practicality.  
It is possible to combine the best of both worlds?
